I had a lot of fun with this assignnment! I especially liked getting creative with the clothing designs and I'm pretty proud of the shirt. The boot thing took me a minute to understand but it worked out.
I got a null pointer exception when trying to display the new instance of scarecrow? 
Also added the word "static" to the objects in the class

Update 10/22/2022
Figured out the null pointer exception! I realized I had to create new instances of all the clothing classes. I still can't figure out why my scanner isn't working for the banner though. 

Later: scanner wasn't working because it wasn't in a method, just stuck in the middle of a class. It took me an embarrassing amount of time to realize this. 

I got most of the stuff working but couldn't figure out how to do the resizable banner using the scanner inputs.
